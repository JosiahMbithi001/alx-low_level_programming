PPRROOLLOOGG
       This  manual  page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The Linux
       implementation of this interface may differ (consult the  corresponding
       Linux  manual page for details of Linux behavior), or the interface may
       not be implemented on Linux.

       The _e_x_i_t utility shall cause the shell to exit  with  the  exit  status
       specified  by  the  unsigned decimal integer _n.  If _n is specified, but
       its value is not between 0 and 255 inclusively, the exit status is  un‐
       defined.

       A  _t_r_a_p  on  EEXXIITT shall be executed before the shell terminates, except
       when the _e_x_i_t utility is invoked in that _t_r_a_p itself, in which case the
       shell shall exit immediately.

       The exit status shall be _n, if specified. Otherwise, the value shall be
       the exit value of the last command executed, or zero if no command  was
       executed.  When  _e_x_i_t is executed in a _t_r_a_p action, the last command is
       considered to be the command that executed  immediately  preceding  the
       _t_r_a_p action.

       As  explained  in  other sections, certain exit status values have been
       reserved for special uses and should be used by applications  only  for
       those purposes:

        126    A  file  to be executed was found, but it was not an executable
               utility.

        127    A utility to be executed was not found.

       >128    A command was interrupted by a signal.
